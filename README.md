# HoloFace
HoloFace is a framework for facial augmented reality on HoloLens, it allows for augmenting the faces of people seen through HoloLens with various items and visual effects. It is described in detail in an article published at the 2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV'2018). 

Look the video below to see HoloFace in action.

## Getting started
In order to run HoloFace you will need Unity (we used Unity 2017.3.0f3) and Visual Studio 2017. 

## Third party libraries and assets
HoloFace uses the [HoloLensForCV library](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloLensForCV) from Microsoft. The library is however included in the HoloFace repo, since we have made minor modifications to its code. Because of that there is no need to download HoloLensForCV separately.

The Unity project includes the following third party assets:
 - Japanese Mask by [Hideout Studio](http://www.hideout-studio.com/), [asset store link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/free-japanese-mask-66432)
 - Starter Particle Pack by [Full Tilt Boogie](http://www.fulltiltboogie.ca/), [asset store link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/starter-particle-pack-83179)
 
All of the assets above were included in the projection with permission from the authors
